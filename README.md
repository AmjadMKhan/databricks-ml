## Implementing Predictive Analytics with Spark in Azure Databricks
A few years ago, I wrote and recorded the edX course [Implementing Predictive Analytics with Spark in Azure HDInsight](https://www.edx.org/course/implementing-predictive-analytics-with-spark-in-azure-hdinsight), which teaches you how to use the Spark MLLib library to build machine learning solutions in a Spark Azure HDInsight cluster.

Microsoft now also offers Spark capabilities in the **Azure Databricks** service. This repo contains versions of the lab files that have been modified to use Azure Databricks.

If you're new to Spark and Databricks, you might want to check out the [Introduction to Databricks Labs](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/databricks-intro) first!

Start by following the [Setup Guide](Setup.pdf) to prepare your Azure environment and download the [labfiles](DAT202.3x-databricks.zip) used in the lab exercises. Then complete the labs in the following order:
1. [Lab 1 - Exploring Data with Spark](Lab%201%20-%20Exploring%20Data%20with%20Spark.pdf).
2. [Lab 2 - Building Supervised Learning Models](Lab%202%20-%20Building%20Supervised%20Learning%20Models.pdf).
3. [Lab 3 - Evaluating Supervised Learning Models](Lab%203%20-%20Evaluating%20Supervised%20Learning%20Models.pdf).
4. [Lab 4 - Recommenders and Clustering](Lab%204%20-%20Recommenders%20and%20Clustering.pdf). 
5. [Lab 5 - Using the MML Spark Library](Lab%205%20-%20Using%20the%20MML%20Spark%20Library.pdf).
